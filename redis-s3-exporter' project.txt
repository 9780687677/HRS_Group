Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

Install Pipenv if you haven't already:
pip install pipenv
git clone <repository-url>
cd redis-s3-exporter
pipenv --python 3.8
pipenv install
Update the exporter.py script with your ElastiCache endpoint, Redis key name, and S3 bucket name.
Usage
Run the exporter script using Pipenv:
pipenv run python exporter.py
Packaging and Deployment
Create a Pipfile to manage dependencies:
pipenv lock
Create a setup.py file for packaging:
pipenv run python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
Deploy the packaged tool to a managed cloud environment, such as AWS Lambda or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
